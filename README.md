# Herbal Remedies Assistant ðŸŒ¿

Herbal Remedies Assistant is an interactive web application designed to provide users with informed answers about herbal remedies and natural medicine. The application leverages advanced natural language processing and vector search technologies to retrieve relevant information from a database of over 1000 herbal remedies.

## Features

- **Interactive Query Interface**: Ask questions about herbal remedies and receive detailed answers.
- **Vector Search**: Uses Chroma DB to find the most relevant information from the database.
- **Transparency**: View the source documents used to generate the answers.
- **Streamlit UI**: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- **[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)**: For building the retrieval chain and managing prompts.
- **[Chroma DB](https://www.trychroma.com/)**: For vector storage and search capabilities.
- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)**: For creating the web application interface.
- **[Ollama LLM](https://ollama.ai/)**: For generating natural language responses.
